# Student Library Assistance System

This project is a complete library management solution for colleges, combining both software and basic hardware automation. It was designed to help students search for books, view fines, and request borrows, while also giving librarians the tools to manage the library more efficiently.

## Overview

The system includes a student login portal, an admin dashboard, and an optional robotic system to demonstrate book retrieval from racks. It uses a web-based interface for managing users, books, and fines. On the hardware side, a simple motor-controlled prototype simulates a system for delivering books.

## Key Features

- Student login to check book availability and fine status
- Admin login to update book records and manage users
- Book search functionality by name, author, or category
- Fine tracking and calculation
- Book request and pre-order system
- Prototype robot to simulate book rack delivery

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- **Backend**: MySQL (local XAMPP server)
- **Hardware**: Arduino UNO, L298N motor driver, servo motors, DC motors

## How It Works

Students can sign in to their dashboard and search for books or request them. They can also see any fines they owe. On the admin side, the librarian can add or remove books, check student information, and approve requests. The robot, which is manually controlled in this prototype, moves to a simulated rack and returns with the book.

## What We Learned

This project gave us experience combining full-stack web development with basic embedded systems. It also helped us understand real-world software design through modular coding and the V-Model development process.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding a mobile app for students
- Notifications for due dates and fines
- Making the robot autonomous for real shelf navigation
- Integrating real-time database access from the robot unit
